# ConteNotes

ConteNotes is a mobile application for Android, which began development in 2024 as part of a Mobile Applications module for my university studies. 
This application's purpose is to provide forensic investigators and other legal professionals with a secure method of keeping contemporaneous notes, which includes keeping accurate timestamps and verifying note integrity using hash comparisons.

## History
